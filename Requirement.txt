Private Room is an innovative platform that connects people, companies and educational institutions
in a secure and flexible digital space. The focus is on private communication, proximity chats and
target group-specific functions that are supported by a unique monetization model.
Main functions of Private Room
Private chats Users can contact specific people or groups - on a request basis. Communication is
enabled through a pay-per-message or subscription model. Chats based on proximity Private Room
uses geolocation to display nearby users and create automatic groups (e.g. neighborhoods, events,
companies or universities).
Automatic groups
Dynamic group creation based on contexts such as workplace, study courses or events. Structured
communication with clear roles (e.g. admins and members). Ghost mode Allows anonymous
interaction in chats without revealing identity or location. Sleeping mode Temporary deactivation of
notifications and activities without being removed from groups. PrivRoom chat policies Chats that
are left automatically delete their history, leaving only the names of the people involved. Long-term
chats must be regularly renewed and paid for.
Monetization functions
Users pay for access to chats or to reconnect after a conversation has ended. Advertising spaces that
make it possible to contact people again. Image and content control Optional blocking of images and
attachments to minimize spam or abuse. Company integration Dedicated channels for internal
communication or customer service.
Boss mode for direct, prioritized messages to teams. Education-specific functions Organized chats
between professors and students. Automatic grouping by courses or topics.
Technical architecture of private room
Server setup: Cloud infrastructure: AWS (Amazon Web Services), Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure as
the basis for scalability and performance. Distributed server architecture to ensure fast data transfer
worldwide.
Database: MongoDB for NoSQL or PostgreSQL for structured data. Separate databases for chat
histories, user data and payment information to ensure maximum security.
Security: end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for private and group chats. Regular penetration tests and
encryption security standards (e.g. TLS 1.3). Redundant servers and backups to prevent data loss.
Geolocalization: Use of APIs such as Google Maps or Mapbox for localization and creation of radius
groups.
Payment gateways: Integration of Stripe, PayPal and localized payment options to ensure global
usability.

The “Private Room” app could definitely fill a niche, especially with the feature of only seeing people
in close proximity and having a large chat group. Here are some considerations and steps to keep in
mind when developing the app:
1. location-based services:
Implement precise GPS tracking to ensure that only users within a 25-50 meter radius are displayed.
2. group chat function:
Develop a stable and user-friendly group chat function that allows everyone to communicate for
free.
3. subscription model:
Integrate a subscription model for private chats. We are considering different price levels and
additional benefits for subscribers.
4. data protection and security:
Ensure that users' data is secure and their privacy is protected.
5. user interface and design:
An appealing and intuitive design is crucial to attract and retain users. But should be similar to
WhatsApp, Telegram or Instagram chat.
These are important features that can have a significant impact on the success of our app. Here are
some specific considerations and recommendations for implementation:
Chat functions
1. group chat:
- Real-time communication: Use WebSockets or similar technologies to enable real-time chat.
- Moderation: Implement moderation tools to ensure the quality of conversations and prevent
inappropriate behavior.
- Notifications: Push notifications for new messages to keep users informed.
2. private chat:
- Subscription model: Offer different subscription options, e.g. monthly, yearly or one-off payments
for certain features.
- Security: Ensure that private messages are encrypted to protect user privacy.
Payment functions
1. subscription models:
- Flexibility: Offer different subscription options, e.g. monthly, yearly or one-off payments for certain
functions.
- In-app purchases: Integrate in-app purchases for additional features or premium content.
2. payment methods:
- Variety: Support different payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Wallet
and other local payment methods.
- Security: Use secure payment gateways to protect users' data.
Further considerations
- Ease of use: An intuitive and appealing design is crucial to improve the user experience.
- Scalability: Make sure your app is scalable to handle a growing user base.
- Feedback loops: Implement mechanisms to collect user feedback and continuously improve
the app.
There is currently no widely used app or program with the exact name “Private Room” that offers the
functions we have described. However, there are many apps that have similar features, such as
location-based chats and group communication. Some examples are:
1. Tinder and Bumble - These apps offer location-based matchmaking and chat features.
2. Happn - Shows you people you've met in real life based on your location.
3. Meetup - Allows you to find and join groups and events near you.
The idea for “Private Room” with a large chat group and the ability to unlock private chats via a
subscription could stand out from these existing apps and fill a unique niche for. It seems that there
is still room for innovation in this area.
