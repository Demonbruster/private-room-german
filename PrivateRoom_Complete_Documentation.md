    App->>User: Show Onboarding Complete
```

The registration flow is designed as a multi-step process that gradually collects user information while providing clear progress indicators. This approach improves completion rates by not overwhelming users with too many fields at once and allows for partial completion with later resumption.

        User->>App: Confirm Subscription
    end
    
    App->>Gateway: Process Payment
    Gateway->>Payment: Payment Authorization Request
    User->>Gateway: Provide Payment Details
